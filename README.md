# About me.

Hi, I'm Max. I hope you enjoyed my site. Let's get a few things out of the way first:

1.  This is my site's readme, I will write silly things like this list. 😵‍💫
2.  I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer and love building software.
3.  I have a cat. He occasionally tries to write code by jumping on the keyboard, but his PR's always get declined. 😥
4.  You can contact me at [hello@maxmueller.miami](mailto:hello@maxmueller.miami).
5.  Flags are cool, so if Vexillology peaked your interest, look into joining [NAVA](https://www.nava.org).
6.  Fun fact: I hold 3 citizenships: 🇦🇷🇺🇸🇵🇱

# About you.

You're looking at my site because you're a flag lover, and possibly a technical recruiter. Hence, I tried to integrate a bit of modern engineering practices with TypeScript + React for you to see. All my code is available in this same github repo.

# About my website.

I bootstrapped this TypeScript app with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). I'm using [Theme-UI](https://theme-ui.com/) for theming, and [this site](https://www.countryflags.io/) for the flag icons.
